# Project Description:
Project aiming at developing an Smart Vacuum Cleaner runs with certain mechanism to define this in an Easier way i have developed certain system Developments and thus done with Simulide Software.

# Initial Case study Block Diagram Development
Initially an case study developed with actual Vaccum cleaner on which the proposed Block diagram been developed as mentioned below.

# Block Diagram specifications 
1. Side Spinning Brush - The side spinning brush reaches along edges to remove dirt, dust and debris. It is easy to install and remove with the use of a coin or similar household item.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Vaccum motor - Vacuum AC motors rotate a motor fan to create vacuum pressure and suction in commercial canister vacuums, material handling, and central vacuuming systems
---------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Bumper sensor -A Bumper Sensor is a switch that reports if it is pressed or released. The Bumper Sensor will report a sensor value of TRUE when the Bumper Sensor is pressed. The Bumper Sensor will report a sensor value of FALSE when the Bumper Sensor is released.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Cliff Sensor - A mechanical cliff sensor is simply a contact that runs along the ground that when a large drop off is encountered - flips a switch or sensor that tells the controller that it has reached a drop off.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Wireless Receiver -The responsibility of the wireless receiver is to pick up the radio signal broadcast by the transmitter and change it back into an audio signal
------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Motor drivers -Motor drivers acts as an interface between the motors and the control circuits
----------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Wheel driving motors -The most basic design is a rather simple integration of an electric motor into the hub of the wheel.

# Proposed Block Diagram
This Block diagram stating with different marketly available sensors used for our Project and hence User-Friendly.

# Proposed Flow Chart
An Proposed Flow chart developed in such a way that our project would be understood in an easier way.

# Simulide Software
Thus our Ultimate Goal to develop an Simulation done with higher level implementation and hence provided with an design of our Project which includes Ultrasonic Sensors, Relays - acts as an Actuators, Motor and respective drivers, Microcontroller and an LCD display
