INTRODUCTION TO MICROWAVE OVEN:



A microwave oven is a relatively small, boxlike oven that raises the temperature of food by subjecting it to a high-frequency electromagnetic field. The microwaves are absorbed by water, fats, sugars, and certain other molecules, whose consequent vibrations produce heat.It is a kitchen appliance that can come in many different sizes and styles employing microwave radiation primarily to cook or heat food. This is accomplished by using microwaves, almost always emitted from a magnetron, to excite water (primarily) and other polarized molecules within the food to be heated. This excitation is fairly uniform, leading to food being heated everywhere all at once.




     •Microwave frequency of 2450 MHz (a wavelength of 12.24 cm).
     •Most molecules are electric dipoles, meaning that they have a positive charge at one end and a negative charge at the other.
     •Water, fat and sugar molecules in the food absorb energy from the microwaves in a process called dielectric heating.
     •This molecular movement creates heat. The heating occurs inside the food without warming the surrounding air.
     •These molecules start vibrating as they try to align themselves with the alternating electric field induced by the microwave.

Controller :


         •It control the times of cooking by turning the microwave energy on and off.
         
         •Power level is determined by the duty cycle. The controller runs the digital clock and timer,
          sets microwave power levels and runs the display.
          
          
          
          
          
          
Operator Control Panel:


                    •A keypad is provided for the operator using which oven can be turned on/off and
                     temperature/ timer settings can be altered.
                    •The controller receives its inputs from the keypad.
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
Interlock Switches:


                    •turn on microwave owen if the swich coonected to it is closed.
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
                    
Front Panel Display:


                    •7-segment LED display,cooking time, temperature ,displaying the remaining time.
                    
                    
Cooking Chamber:


                    •Glass panel for easy viewing, but has a layer of conductive mesh to maintain the
                     shielding.
                     
                    •Food absorbs the microwaves and becomes hotter in the cooking chamber.
                   
                     
                     
                     
                     
Cooling fans:
             
             
             •To evoporate heat
             
             
             
             
             
Buzzer:


      •Buzzer is used for alerting the user at the completion of the cooking process.
      
      
      
      
      
Low Voltage Power Supply Unit:


      •A low voltage power supply unit supplies power to all electronic circuits, fans and motors.
      
      
      
      
      
Advantages of microwave cooking:


                           • Excellent quality of food
                           • Enhances color and texture of food.
                           • Cooking requires minimum quantity of water in retaining most of the nutrients.
                           • Time required for cooking is veryless
                           • Preserves natural Flavor of the food.
