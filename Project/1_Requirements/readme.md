# SMART VACUUM CLEANER 
# Project Description:
We live in a period in which the automation had taken place a vital role and through which the process of implementing the new things through robotic and automation have developed in a better and Efficient ways.This makes me an motivation to come up with an Effective way of developing an SMART VACUUM CLEANER Which was done under various Technique which involves Sensors, Actuators, Microcontrollers and so on.

# FEAUTURES
* Cleans our Home even without human interuption
* Reduces human efforts. 
* Low Cost & Easy to use.
* Data can be accessed from any part of the world.
* Easy to Design
